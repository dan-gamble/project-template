#Â project-template

This is the project template that the [Onespacemedia](http://www.onespacemedia.com) team use to start their projects. It uses the excellent [Cookiecutter](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter) project as a foundation and makes use of a lot of it's features in the generation process.

## Getting started

To start a project using this template, follow these steps:

1. Be in whichever directory you would like the project to be created in (for us, this is `~/Workspace`).
2. Ensure you have `cookiecutter` installed - ```pip install cookiecutter```, yes it has to be installed globally on your system.
3. Run `cookiecutter gh:onespacemedia/project-template`
4. Answer the questions.
5. That's it!

You will need to add a Git remote and probably set up a few other things. Work is ongoing to improve the inital process.
